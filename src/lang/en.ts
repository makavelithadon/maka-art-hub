<h1 id="text03">Pricing and sizes</h1>
<div id="list05" className="list">
  <ul>
    <li>
        The price depends on the complexity of the chosen painting,
        the size of the artwork, and the shipping costs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please understand that pricing will be higher for complex
        references due to the time and level of detail
        required for an accurate result.

<h1>shipping</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
        I ship <strong>worldwide</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Shipping cost depends on your location and the weight
        of the order.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please understand that international shipping fees
        can be high. I have no control over these rates and do not
        profit from them. They are set by the carrier
        I use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any customs fees are not included in the total price and
        remain the responsibility of the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the painting is completed, shipping takes
        <strong>3 to 7 days or more</strong> depending on your location.
    </li>
    <li>
        I always purchase additional insurance from the carrier. This slightly increases the shipping cost, but allows me to protect against potential issues during transit.
    </li>
  </ul>

        👉 All canvas paintings are sealed with acrylic spray varnish
        to ensure better preservation and long-term durability.
    </li>
